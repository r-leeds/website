# Website
Website for the Leeds R Users group.
  
Created with the help of [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
  
The site makes use of the [ghostwriter](https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter) theme ported to Hugo by [jbub](https://github.com/jbub), with modified colours.
