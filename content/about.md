We are in the process of organising a monthly meetup for R users in Leeds, UK.
The talks will be hosted at the offices of [Sky Betting & Gaming](https://skybetcareers.com/) in Leeds.
  
Details of our meetings will be posted on a Meetup page.
Slides from the talks will be shared on this site.
  
This group is organised by [Ed Berry](https://twitter.com/ed_berry), and [Robin Lovelace](https://www.robinlovelace.net/about/).
