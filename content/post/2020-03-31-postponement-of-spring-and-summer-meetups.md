We hope everyone is safe and healthy. We are sorry to announce that due to the current situation, we are postponing our spring and summer meetups. In the meantime, if you have any ideas for the group or would like to volunteer for a future talk, please get in touch with us. You can do that on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/r_users_leeds), [GitHub](https://github.com/r-leeds), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/R_USERS_LEEDS), and [email](mailto:r.users.leeds@gmail.com). We are unfortunately not able to provide any virtual sessions at the moment; however, if you would like us to share a webinar you are doing, please let us know.

If you would like to revisit the presentations from previous meetup. Please see the corresponding slides below:

* [*Slides: Reproducible wRiting with RMarkdown*](https://www.eddjberry.com/talks/reproducible-writing-with-rmarkdown.html#1). [Ed Berry](https://eddjberry.com), Senior Data Scientist, Sky Betting & Gaming
* [*Slides: Efficient WoRkflows getting more done with R*](https://www.robinlovelace.net/presentations/efficient-workflows.html#1). [Robin Lovelace](https://www.robinlovelace.net), University Academic Fellow, University of Leeds 
* [*Slides: Putting the R into Reproducible Research*](https://annakrystalli.me/talks/r-in-repro-research-dc.html#1]). [Anna Krystalli](https://annakrystalli.me), Research Software Engineer, University of Sheffield

We realise that many of you are currently looking for their daily dose of R virtually. Please see the following brief list of few resources that could help you to keep up to date with R:

* The [Rweekly](https://rweekly.org/) is the go to page to follow if you want to see what's up.
* Open Culture has plenty of MOOC resources on [Computer science](http://www.openculture.com/computer_science_free_courses).
* R Studio's [r conference](https://resources.rstudio.com/) is always worth checking out. There's lots of webinars and talks from the conference.
* Thomas Lin Pedersen has prepared two webinars on [ggplot2 - part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h29g21z0a68) and [ggplot2 - part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m4yywqNPVY).
* Lastly, if you want to practice R, try the weekly [R tidy tuesdays](https://www.tidytuesday.com/). They do a small [challange](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) each week.

This is only a `glimpse()` of what's out there but we hope this will help you a bit to get started and keep up to date!


Thank you for your patience before we'll get back to you with the next R Leeds Users Meetup. We hope your are staying safe and in a good health.

See you in the autumn!
