We hope everyone is doing well. We are happy to announce that the next meetup is being scheduled. We heard your calls and requests for doing an online webinar/session/meetup and plan to prepare exactly that. 

The next meetup will be held on the 12th of August 2020 from 2 PM to 3 PM (BST). More information will be posted (updated) here closer to the date (alongside the platform where the meetup will be held), however, we plan to have some exciting presentations for you on the following topics:

*	Introduction to the Shiny Dashboard

*	Introduction to Git version-control system

We had an amazing response for the meetup back in December 2019 and hope to continue with similar attendance.

More exciting news will come soon.
