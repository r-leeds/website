We hope everyone is doing well. We are happy to announce that the next meetup is scheduled. We heard your calls and requests for doing an online webinar/session/meetup and plan to prepare exactly that. 

The next meetup will be held on the 12th of August 2020 from 2 PM to 3 PM (BST). You can register to attend the meetup using this <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/r-users-leeds-summer-virtual-meetup-tickets-114455986938" target="_blank">Eventbrite link</a>. 

We plan to have some exciting presentations for you on the following topics:

*	An Introduction to Version Control with Git. Seb Goring, Senior Data Scientist, Sky Betting & Gaming

*	An Introduction to R Shiny Dashboards. Natasha Chetwynd, Information Analyst Graduate, NHS Digital

We had an amazing response for the meetup back in December 2019 and hope to continue with similar attendance.
